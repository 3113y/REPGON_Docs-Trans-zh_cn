# Class "Sprite"

Currently, this class does not have any new additions in REPENTOGON, only reimplemented versions of functions already in the API with added functionality.

## Modified Functions

### Replace·Spritesheet () {: aria-label='Functions' }
#### void ReplaceSpritesheet ( int LayerId, string PngFilename, bool︎ LoadGraphics = false ) {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }
Now accepts an optional `bool` to determine if Sprite:LoadGraphics should be called after replacing the spritesheet. In most cases, you'll want to do this.
